# Single-session execution

Use the checkout, two-branch limit and one-writer policy in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). [Codex setup](docs/agents/codex.md) owns synchronization; this file owns only the Shop implementation and reference loop.

## Resume, do not restart

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), [current status](docs/STATUS.md), the owning [task](tasks.md), and [the implementation map](shop-implementation-map.md). Inspect actual source and git state. Load only the relevant source family and skill, not all archived docs. Do not create another parity pipeline or recount routes as completed screens.

The active queue spans the Shop frontend parts of Tasks 3/5/6. Start from the current recipes and reproduce the relevant outstanding issue. Finish complete related families, including connected interactions, before moving onward. Keep the rest of the frozen corpus in scope; avoid polishing one card indefinitely while leaving other states unmapped.

## Existing local reference loop

Confirm the repository, branch, pinned runtime, ignored local assets and listener ownership. Review `.github/workflows/shop-parity.yml` and `playwright.reference.config.ts` for the existing harness. The documented local parity preview uses these explicit environment values in the SAME terminal that starts the server:

```powershell
$env:SHOP_REFERENCE_PREVIEW = '1'
$env:VERCEL_ENV = 'preview'
$env:SHOP_PARITY_BASE_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:6412'
$env:PLAYWRIGHT_CHANNEL = 'chrome'
node prepare-shop-reference.mjs --verify
pnpm --filter @treido/web exec next dev --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 6412
```

Use the installed browser channel actually available. `--verify` checks the existing allowlisted media; a failure requires provenance-aware preparation/review, not new expected hashes. Starting this opt-in preview does not authorize any real provider action. Do not reuse an unidentified listener or take over another project's server.

If the local pnpm shim fails, use the already installed runtime; do not reinstall the stack. Verified on2026-09-20: Node24.19 at `C:/Users/radev/.cache/codex-runtimes/codex-primary-runtime/dependencies/node/bin/node.exe`, Next16.3.4 at `apps/web/node_modules/next/dist/bin/next`. After confirming6412 is free and no Treido dev/build process owns the same output directory, start persistently from PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:SHOP_REFERENCE_PREVIEW = '1'
$env:VERCEL_ENV = 'preview'
$nodeRuntimeDir = 'C:\Users\radev\.cache\codex-runtimes\codex-primary-runtime\dependencies\node\bin'
$env:PATH = $nodeRuntimeDir + ';' + $env:PATH
Start-Process -FilePath "$nodeRuntimeDir\node.exe" `
  -ArgumentList 'node_modules/next/dist/bin/next','dev','--hostname','127.0.0.1','--port','6412' `
  -WorkingDirectory 'J:\treido-bg\apps\web' -WindowStyle Hidden `
  -RedirectStandardOutput 'J:\treido-bg\.qa\shop-parity\preview.stdout.log' `
  -RedirectStandardError 'J:\treido-bg\.qa\shop-parity\preview.stderr.log' -PassThru
```

Use unused log filenames when earlier evidence must be retained. Verify the new listener and a rendered Browser page; do not assume a returned process ID proves readiness. Reuse a healthy existing server. For other commands, invoke installed Node directly against the existing root Playwright/TypeScript/Prettier CLIs. Run source ESLint from `apps/web` so its actual configuration applies. Do not start dev and build in the same output directory concurrently.

In a second terminal with the same runtime and base-URL/browser environment, use the existing commands with the selected family and an honest run identifier:

```sh
node scripts/shop-parity/run.mjs enumerate
node scripts/shop-parity/run.mjs baseline --all --flows 14-16,40-41,96-97 --run YOUR_RUN_ID
node scripts/shop-parity/run.mjs compare-runs --before BEFORE_RUN --after AFTER_RUN
```

Run the relevant existing Playwright specs with the reference config. To use the confirmed preview already serving 6412, set `$env:REFERENCE_BASE_URL='http://127.0.0.1:6412'`; the harness validates loopback HTTP and does not start a second server. If using its separate development-server path instead, unset that override and use `REFERENCE_DEV=1`, which owns port 3103. Stop only the confirmed owned 6412 runtime before the separate harness uses the same `.next` directory, then restart the capture preview if needed. The default path without either override requires an existing production build. Do not mistake that default for the running dev preview.

`scripts/shop-parity/ledger.mjs` takes the recorded run ID as its positional argument when regenerating the dated ledger from real evidence. Do not regenerate acceptance from mere source definitions.

## Decide and act

Start with the [shared-component audit map](shop-implementation-map.md#shared-component-audit). For a related family, inspect every source control and variant, map it to its current component/state, and correct the common owner. Compare glyph ink and hit targets separately; include cards, headers, navigation, sheets, fields, selected/loading/disabled states, shadows and photograph boundaries. Preserve source-specific variants rather than adding global overrides from one screenshot. Then traverse the entire family in Browser and inspect sibling consumers. A broad inventory should produce immediate implementation batches, not consume a whole session without code.

Inspect ordered source and live pairs; fix the canonical owner. Exercise actual Back/Forward, overlays, keyboard, focus, scrolling and state persistence. Wait for the target UI state, fonts and decoded images. Verify related sibling states and relevant 320/430 widths before keeping a shared change.

Treat current access/permission failures precisely. Historical failures are dated evidence, not permanent claims that a tool or file is unavailable. Verify current permitted access without evading an actual denial. An unavailable computer is not proof that GitHub access is unavailable.

## Close a coherent batch

Run scoped checks, preserve original assertions and diagnostic thresholds, record exact source/run/evidence and update the owning task/flow records. Follow the root commit/synchronization contract and leave unrelated work untouched. Update the current resume note rather than appending another contradictory queue.

The browser/source gate is not payment, native or production acceptance. Missing proof is reported as not run or unresolved. Continue the next useful related work within the current request; do not ask the owner to approve routine component edits.

## New-session prompt

Copy the following into the next session in this same project:

```text
Continue implementing the ENTIRE frozen Shop buyer mobile-web UI/UX 1:1 in J:\treido-bg. This is implementation work, not another plan or test-only pass. Preserve the current canonical checkout, branch and all local work; no new clone/worktree, framework upgrade, backend/native work, food rebrand or deployment.

Read AGENTS.md, product.md, docs/STATUS.md, Tasks 3/5/6 in tasks.md, then single-session-execution.md and the current checkpoint, shared-component audit map and open obligations in shop-implementation-map.md. Use the relevant parity/frontend/UI-verification skills and installed-version framework guidance. Do not reread the historical documentation library.

Application checkpoint b302d88 follows Store/PDP fe3d5e6, Home/Deals 6b89210 and Account/Reviews/Saved/Cart 30f336e. Search/Mini drafts, Gift collection identity, Skin lower controls/photographs and bounded Jeans photo entries are implemented. Read docs/STATUS.md for subsequent local changes; preserve all of them. Reuse http://127.0.0.1:6412. The separately owned immutable6413 server serves the4bda84e qualification build; do not confuse it with later development edits. Use @Browser at393x793, affected320/430 widths and467x853 store/cart.

All 97 flows / 424 ordered frames have mappings and capture evidence, not completed 1:1. The complete ledger is clean b8377ff / 20260920-connected-qualified-full (57 numerical candidates, 367 requiring refinement), with zero replay/browser errors. Application 4bda84e passes the build and 132 units; journeys initially pass 357/358 and the source-corrected caption assertion passes its exact 1/1 rerun. Read the original failure and run precedence in the implementation map. All 755 frozen files verify; 307 standalone images are reconciled and none of 16 standalone videos contains audio. Exact motion and named platform/source limitations remain open.

Work component-first and flow-by-flow. Scan every visible button/icon/card/field/header/dock/sheet/menu plus selected, disabled, loading and error variants in each source family. Map source frame -> current route/state -> canonical component -> discrepancy -> implementation -> evidence. Fix shared owners once, preserve real source variants, and check their sibling screens. Do not clone screenshot backgrounds with baked controls, invent hidden assets or substitute a nearby product/state. Reuse existing state/actions and complete navigation, Back/Forward, focus, scrolling, keyboard, persistence and cancellation.

Use up to three subagents for bounded independent audits and one source writer at a time. Next: Receipt spacing/payment information, source-specific Orders recommendation photography, remaining receipt/recommendation returns and checkout thumbnail/rounded-star variants. Then shared PDP text/offer/StoreRow/review-star finishing, Home accessory hearts and PDP collection creation history. Saved nested options/edit/public/delete history follows; preserve source Cancel dismissing the whole sheet. Root Browser negative evidence records those collection gaps. Search/Mini final evidence is49 unique frames,7/7 new journeys and25/25 final router siblings; final Browser verifies reload Close/Back/Forward and Skin hearts above Home at320/393/430. Reload while away still limits parent drafts; responsive erasure halos remain. Source-bound partial products must not become invented inventory. Preserve gallery16px inset; source8px swipe displacement is not a proven settled target. Review copy keeps Wes punctuation and Juanita’s “from you”; the old missing Shea chart claim is stale. Implement queued owners, verify siblings, then continue every unresolved family without routine confirmation.

Write real code in coherent batches. Visually compare each affected source sequence in Browser, then use existing scoped capture and interaction checks. Run types/lint as appropriate; avoid repeated full-suite/build runs after cosmetic edits. Keep masks, hashes, thresholds and meaningful assertions intact. Do not confuse passing tests or low average pixel error with 1:1.

Update shop-parity-checklist.md with flow-specific implementation/UX/width evidence and remaining exceptions as each family is completed. Keep shop-frame-ledger.md tied to a real complete run; record later scoped evidence in shop-implementation-map.md. Update docs/STATUS.md with exact commits, checks and next unresolved work. Do not create another backlog or mark acceptance on my behalf. Continue safe implementation without routine permission requests. Do not declare the entire app done while visible differences or incomplete app-owned flows remain.
